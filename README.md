# sample-survey-design
Please open the index.html to understand the flow of this sample website.
Segment 1: There you will find three variable in <script> tag. 1) survey_intro 2) survey_sample_page 3) survey_finish
These three variables are the definition of each page of the survey.

Segment 2: `jsPsych.init` is the initialization of the page. Here `timeline` object will contain the variable declared earlier. The sequence of these in variables should be in the way which you want participants to watch. `on_finish` object will contain a js function which will derive at the end of survey what actions will be taken or done.
